The purpose of this project is many.  The main purpose is to provide a system to add messages to an LED sign [Links to my LED sign](https://supermitsuba.github.io/2013/07/14/led-bulletin-board/).  Here are a few features:

1. Write weather to sign
2. Write forecast to sign
3. Write messages (up to 32 characters) to sign
4. Turn on/off sign
5. Containerized system to allow independent upgrades and easier deployments
6. API's to extend the project later

This project has given me many different purposes or technologies to play with, for instances:

1. Docker containers
2. Golang environment
3. Docker Hub images
4. Message Queues
5. APIs
6. Web sites
7. Tiny distributed system
